# Change Log 
Godot Project Breakdown

## 2.0.0
22/3/2020<br>
I made the extension using Godot Tools 0.3.X. Current Godot Tools versions (1.X.X) changes the some things with the symbols and added more functionality, so I've updated the extension to work with latest Godot Tools versions.
#### Added
- Support for Godot Tools v1.X.X and above.
:bangbang:**NOTE:** If you are using a previous Godot Tools version (under 1.X.X), use Godot Project Breakdown 1.0.1)

## 1.0.1 
20/3/2020
#### Added
- Now is possible to get enum info from files
- Allows excluding files/folders (Added glob pattern setting (godotProjectBreakdown.file.ignoreFolders))
- Cancelling option for clossing dialog
#### Fixed
- Solved bug: extension crashed when a file only contained enum(s)
- Bug when getting the extend of a file


## 1.0.0
- Initial release
